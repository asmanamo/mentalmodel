# Mental Model – System Layers Profiler

This repository contains a small CLI tool designed as a **thinking aid**,  
not a system profiler.

It helps engineers reason about performance and reliability issues  
by visualizing problems across system layers:
CPU, Memory, Disk, Network, OS, Runtime, Framework, Cloud, AI.

More details coming soon.
